# EVI

Emotional Virtual Intelligence - modular prototype.

This application provides a PyQt5 dashboard to experiment with hormone levels and emotional visualization. Hormones are adjusted with sliders and their effect on emotions is displayed in a live radar chart. A simple chat interface stores all messages along with hormone states.

Run the GUI:

```bash
python evi_gui.py
```

Requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.

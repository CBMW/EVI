# EVI - Emotional Virtual Intelligence

EVI is a modular prototype exploring the integration of emotion into large language model systems. It simulates a basic hormone system that influences emotional states, with the goal of enhancing AI interaction, decision-making, and personality.

This application provides a PyQt5-based dashboard to experiment with hormone levels and visualize resulting emotions in real time. Hormone levels are adjusted via sliders, and a radar chart reflects the emotional output live. A basic chat interface stores all dialogue along with the corresponding hormone states. Settings include fields for configuring the LLM API key and initial system prompt.

## Running the Interface

To start the GUI:

```bash
python evi_gui.py
Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
```

## Project Goals
Create a framework that enhances LLM-based artificial intelligence by incorporating emotion into chat, decision-making, and memory.

## Use cases include:
• emotionally aware companion AI
• ethically influenced reasoning through emotion
• accessibility support for individuals with mental health challenges or cognitive impairments

# EVI

Emotional Virtual Intelligence - early prototype.

This repository contains a simple PyQt5 dashboard with sliders to visualize "hormone" levels and a basic chat interface. The application stores messages in a JSON file along with the current hormone state. When adrenaline rises above a threshold while the user is typing, the AI will automatically send a calming message.

Requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.
